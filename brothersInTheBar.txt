1. Set a counter for successful rounds and a boolean to identify when a round is successsful.
2. Identiy the constraints for max and min values for the length of the input array and the value of each index.
3. Creating a loop that validates the length of the array.
4. Creating a loop that goes through every index in the array.
5. Validating the value of the index.
6. Saving the values of 3 consequtive indexes starting from the current one.
7. If values are equal we have a successful round. So we add one to rounds and extract the glasses that made up the round from the originl array. 
8. Otherwise, if the selected 3 values are not equal we do not have a successful round.
9. If there are no successful rounds in the whole array, the cycle breaks.
10. We print the result of how many rounds the brothers had.
